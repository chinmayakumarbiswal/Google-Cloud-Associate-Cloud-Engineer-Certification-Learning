# Basicd of Cloud Computing 
Cloud computing is the on demand delivery of compute resources like Storage, database, networking, etc. 

## Characteristics of Cloud Computing
1. On-demand Self Service
2. Broad Network Access
3. Resource Pooling
4. Rapid Elasticity
5. Measured Services


## What is IAAS, PAAS, SAAS ?

1. IAAS (Infrastructure as a Service):<br>
    **Description:** IaaS is the most basic layer of cloud computing. It provides virtualized computing resources over the internet, including servers, storage, networking, and sometimes other infrastructure components like load balancers and firewalls.<br>

    **Use Case:** IaaS is suitable for users who need control over the infrastructure, such as managing virtual machines, storage, and network configurations. It's often used for hosting and running applications where users have full control over the operating system and software stacks.<br>

    **Examples:** Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and IBM Cloud.<br>

2. PaaS (Platform as a Service):<br>
    **Description:** PaaS is a higher-level service that provides a platform for building, deploying, and managing applications. It includes infrastructure components but also offers development tools, databases, and middleware to streamline application development.<br>

    **Use Case:**    PaaS is ideal for developers who want to focus on coding and not worry about the underlying infrastructure. It's commonly used for web and mobile app development and is particularly useful for teams collaborating on software projects.<br>

    **Examples:**    Heroku, Google App Engine, Microsoft Azure App Service, and Red Hat OpenShift.<br>

3. SaaS (Software as a Service):<br>
    **Description:** SaaS is the top layer of cloud computing. It delivers fully functional software applications over the internet on a subscription basis. Users access the software through a web browser, and the provider handles all maintenance and updates.<br>

    **Use Case:**    SaaS is perfect for end-users who want to use software without the complexities of installation, maintenance, and management. It's commonly used for productivity software, email services, customer relationship management (CRM), and more.<br>

    **Examples:**    Microsoft Office 365, Salesforce, Google Workspace, Dropbox, and Slack.<br>
