# Google Cloud resources hierarchy: 
Google Cloud resources are organized hierarchically, with each node (Organization, Folders, Projects, and so forth) having a reference to its parent. This hierarchy helps you to organize your resources in a logical way, making it easier to manage and control them.

## Organization
The organization node is the root node in the hierarchy. It represents the top-level of your Google Cloud account. You can have only one organization node.

## Folders
Folders are optional nodes that you can use to group your projects together. Folders can be nested up to 10 levels deep.

## Projects
Projects are the basic building blocks of Google Cloud. They contain all of your Google Cloud resources, such as Compute Engine VMs, Cloud Storage buckets, and App Engine instances.

## Resources
Resources are the individual components that make up your Google Cloud applications and services. Examples of resources include Compute Engine VMs, Cloud Storage buckets, and App Engine instances.
