# Google Cloud resources hierarchy: 
Google Cloud resources are organized hierarchically, with each node (Organization, Folders, Projects, and so forth) having a reference to its parent. This hierarchy helps you to organize your resources in a logical way, making it easier to manage and control them.

## Organization
The organization node is the root node in the hierarchy. It represents the top-level of your Google Cloud account. You can have only one organization node.

## Folders
Folders are optional nodes that you can use to group your projects together. Folders can be nested up to 10 levels deep.

## Projects
Projects are the basic building blocks of Google Cloud. They contain all of your Google Cloud resources, such as Compute Engine VMs, Cloud Storage buckets, and App Engine instances.

## Resources
Resources are the individual components that make up your Google Cloud applications and services. Examples of resources include Compute Engine VMs, Cloud Storage buckets, and App Engine instances. <br><br>

## Benefits of using a Google Cloud resources hierarchy
There are several benefits to using a Google Cloud resources hierarchy:
1. Organization: <br>
  A hierarchy helps you to organize your resources in a logical way, making it easier to find and manage them.
2. Access control: <br>
  You can use IAM permissions to control who has access to different levels of the hierarchy. For example, you could give a team of developers access to a specific folder containing their projects, while giving a team of administrators access to the entire organization.
3. Billing: <br>
  You can track and manage your billing costs at the organization, folder, or project level. This can be helpful for identifying and reducing costs.

## Best practices for using a Google Cloud resources hierarchy
When designing your Google Cloud resources hierarchy, it's important to keep the following best practices in mind:

1. Mirror your organizational structure: <br>
  The Google Cloud resource hierarchy should reflect how your company is organized. For example, you could create a folder for each department in your company.
2. Use folders to group related projects: <br>
  Group projects together in folders based on their function or purpose. For example, you could create a folder for all of your production projects and another folder for all of your development projects.
3. Use IAM permissions to control access: <br>
  Use IAM permissions to control who has access to different levels of the hierarchy. This will help to ensure that only authorized users have access to your resources.
4. Track and manage your billing costs: <br>
  Track and manage your billing costs at the organization, folder, or project level. This can be helpful for identifying and reducing costs.
